          <strong>1941</strong> - Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5<sup>th</sup> in the town of Akebono-cho in Bunkyo, Tokyo. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki was the director of Miyazaki Airpane, which manufactured rudders for fighter plans during World War II. This business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1944</strong> - When Miyazaki was three years old, his family evacuated to Utsunomiya and then after the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, who was aged four at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1950</strong> - During Junior High School, he aspired to become a manga artist, but discovered he could not draw people; instead, he only drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years. He was influenced by several manga artists, such as Osamu Tezuka and Soji Yamakawa, but Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, beleiving it was "bad form" to copy Tezuka's style.

          <strong>1959</strong> - After graduating from Toyotama High School, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University and was a member of the "Children's Literature Research Club", the "closest thing back then to a comics club."

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1963</strong> - Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin with degress in political science and economics. He then got a job with Toei Animation
